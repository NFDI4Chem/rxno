[MOP, the molecular process ontology](https://code.google.com/p/rxno/wiki/MOP), describes processes at the molecular level.

[RXNO, the name reaction ontology](https://code.google.com/p/rxno/wiki/RXNO), connects organic name reactions such as the Diels-Alder cyclization and the Cannizzaro reaction to their roles in an organic synthesis and to processes in MOP.

This project also contains [a tentative mapping of molecular activities in GO to those in MOP](https://rxno.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/go_mop_mapping.owl).
