Flowchart for determination of skeleton

* A single starting material must always be defined in order for these rules to work.
* To determine the skeleton in the product in cases where it is not obvious, imagine the reaction being run in reverse, and follow the flowchart as usual.
* X = heteroatom group (where heteroatom = any non-metal or metalloid element other than C or H).

1. Do any heteroatoms (or linear chains of heteroatoms) form part of a ring?
* N: 2
* Y: Select these atoms. Go to 2. 

2. Are any unselected heteroatoms (or linear chains of heteroatoms) connected to two or more C atoms?
* N: Select all the C atoms in the starting material. END
* Y: 3

3. Are any of the C-X bonds to this heteroatom broken during the reaction?
* N: Select these atoms. Go to 2.
* Y: 4

4. Out of the C-X bonds to this atom in the starting material, how many remain in the desired product?
* none: 5
* one: 6
* two or more: Select these atoms. Go to 6.

5. Are all of the C-X bonds to this heteroatom broken?
* N: 6
* Y: Select these atoms. Go to 6.

6. Select all the carbon atoms present in the starting material that are also present in the desired product of the reaction. END
